# WRAITER: Next Generation AI Content Writer
The AI Content Writer Tool is a Python-based application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 DaVinci 003 model to generate high-quality content for various purposes such as email, blog, and social media captions. The tool is designed to help users save time and effort in writing content by generating responses that are clear, concise, and professional.


# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenAI API key (Available on OpenAI website)


# Features
WRAITER comes with the following features:
    1. User-friendly interface that guides users through the process of generating different forms of text.
    2. Ability to generate content in a range of different tones, including formal and informal.
    3. Automatic copying of blogs/captions and automatic shipping of the email to your email client.
    4. Compatibility with a range of machines and platforms.

WRAITER offers three different content generation options:

    1. Email
    2. Blog
    3. Social Media Caption 



# Getting Started
To use WRAITER, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
    3. Obtain an API key for OpenAI and replace the placeholder key in the code with your own key. (This will not be needed in future stages)
    4. Run the application by executing the WRAITER.py file in your terminal.


# How to Use
Upon running WRAITER.py, you will be prompted to enter your name. After providing your name, you will be presented with a menu of options to choose from:

1. Email
2. Blog
3. Social Media Caption

Depending on the option chosen, you will be prompted to provide additional information such as the subject of the email/blog post/caption, the target audience, and the tone of the content. This information will be used to generate a prompt, which will be passed through to the OpenAI API to generate the content.

***Email***
When you choose the email option, you will be prompted to provide the recipient's name, email ID, the email subject, tone of the email, and any additional information you would like to include. The prompt generated by the input will be passed through to the OpenAI API to generate the email body. Once generated, the email will be opened in the default email client with the email body and subject pre-filled for you.

***Blog***
When you chooses the blog option, you will be prompted to provide the subject of the blog post, the target audience, the different sections of the blog, and any additional information you would like to include. The prompt generated by the input will be passed through to the OpenAI API to generate the blog post. Once generated, the blog post will be copied to your clipboard.

***Social Media Caption***
When you choose the social media caption option, you will be prompted to provide the subject of the social media post, the platform it is for, the tone of the caption, and any additional information you would like to include. The prompt generated by the input will be passed through to the OpenAI API to generate the caption along with 10 hashtags relevant to the context. Once generated, the caption will be copied to your clipboard.


# Functions
email_parameters(name): This function takes in the user's name as an input and generates a prompt to pass through to the OpenAI API for generating an email. It prompts the user to enter the recipient's name, email ID, subject of the email, tone of the email, and any additional information to be included in the email. The function returns the prompt along with the recipient's name, email ID, subject, tone, and any additional information.

blog_parameters(): This function generates a prompt to pass through to the OpenAI API for generating a blog post. It prompts the user to enter the subject of the blog post, the audience demographic information, different sections of the blog post, and any additional information to be included in the blog post. The function returns the prompt.

caption_parameters(): This function generates a prompt to pass through to the OpenAI API for generating a social media caption. It prompts the user to enter the subject of the social media post, the platform for which the caption is to be generated, relevant adjectives for the caption, and any additional information to be included in the caption. The function returns the prompt.

api_request(user_prompt): This function calls the OpenAI API and generates a response based on the prompt passed as an argument. It uses the openai.Completion.create method to generate text by providing the model_engine, user_prompt, max_tokens, n, stop, and temperature parameters. The **max_tokens** parameter is used to limit the length of the generated text. The **temperature** parameter controls the creativity of the response by influencing the randomness of the output. A low temperature value produces more predictable and conservative responses, while a higher temperature value produces more creative and unpredictable responses. The function returns the generated response.

main(): This function is the main function that runs the program. It prompts the user to enter their name and then displays a menu with options to choose from (email, blog, social media caption). The user selects an option, and the function then calls the appropriate prompt generation function and passes the generated prompt to the OpenAI API to generate text. For email, the function opens the default email client with the generated text. For blog and social media caption, the function copies the generated text to the clipboard.


# Conclusion
WRAITER is a powerful AI content generation tool that can help you save time and effort while writing high-quality content for various purposes. It uses the OpenAI API to generate content based on user inputs, making it easy to write professional-grade content even if you're not an expert in writing.
